            Welcome! I graduated with a 
            <span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0); font-weight:bold;">Master's degree in Computer Science </span>
            from San Francisco State University (SFSU) in December 2022. My focus is on 
            <span style="color: rgb(20, 210, 255); font-weight:bold;">Computer Vision</span> 
            ,
            <span style="color: rgb(0, 210, 130); font-weight:bold;">Virtual Reality</span> 
            and 
            <span style="color: rgb(20, 255, 184); font-weight:bold;">Simulation</span> related projects, but 
            I am open to other opportunities too.
            <br>
            <br>
            My primary programming languages are  <span style="color: rgb(0, 68, 255); font-weight:bold;">C++</span>, 
            <span style="color: rgb(120, 30, 255); font-weight:bold;">C#</span>, 
            and <span style="color: rgb(255, 200, 0); font-weight:bold;">Python</span>. Currently, I am writting with C++ 
            to imitate Pytorch's implementation to build a scientific computation package without dependencies.
            I also planned out projects to emulate Arduino and Raspberry Pi with C++, which will provide me with a 
            deep understanding of "bare metal" programming. 
            Python is my primary language for prototyping research projects since Pytorch is such a convenient 
            tool to build deep learning models. I am also familiar with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React framework from past project experiences. You can

            I also obtained an <span style="color: rgb(255, 123, 0); font-weight:bold;">MBA degree</span> 
            from SFSU in 2019. During my MBA study, I had an opportunity to take a couple of graduate-level CS courses, where 
            I found a true passion in my life. I did not want to switch to the CS major at that time because I was so 
            close to finishing the MBA program and have secured a job promotion. However, the joy I had with CS is really 
            imprinted in my mind, and I kept thinking about it. The change happened when COVID started since all meetings were 
            moved to online paltforms. Staying with my job and studying at school became a viable option. Therefore, I decided 
            to make a leap to pursue my dream career. This is how the new chapter of my life begins.

            <p style="margin-top: 10px;"> 
              This project is based on the SMPL and UNet++ model to construct a targeted human figure. 
              Vertex2Image uses SMPL vertices to collect color and motion information. 
              Vertex2Image is presenting a human figure but not constructing an actual human model.
              With a given camera direction, we can determine which vertices are in the scene, then feed 
              the vertices' information into the model to present what the scene should look like. The biggest 
              advantage we have over other models is the training speed. The model only needs 2 hours of training 
              on a single GPU to construct high-fidelity human figures, instead of spending a few hours with 
              multiple GPUs or spending a few days with a single GPU.

              This project is an internal tool for a Chinese company, which provides services to Chinese Muslim cemeteries. 
              One part of their business is to locate where a tomb is based on name search. In China, most Muslim cemeteries 
              are not well maintained. Therefore, there is no such database they can use directly. The employees take images 
              for the tombs, then manually input the tomb information into their database. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I built a deep learning model to extract such information from images in order to reduce their 
              labor cost. However, due to the complexity of mixed text structures and its unique ways of grouping text, 
              no existing deep learning models could handle this task, and no existing dataset could match what I need to 
              train a new model. 
              <br>
              <br>
              I could not use existing annotation tools for two reasons. First, there is no good Chinese annotation tool 
              they can use. Second, I need to capture the pattern of how employees group text in the image. No existing 
              tool allows to gather such data when employees labeling on the images. Therefore, I had to build from scratch. 
              It took me two months to achieve the goal.

              The key idea of this project is to utilize the detected 2D joints' locations from multiple frames to 
              estimate the joints in the 3D space.
              With multi-views, I can perform Triangulation on key joints, then sample points at where the lines are 
              clustered. Send these points through the MLP network to convert low-dimension spatial information into 
              high-dimension. With these points, I design a network that learn the spatial information in each frame, 
              then feed into next component to gather temporal information.

              This project aims to build a neural network library and interface with C++, CUDA, and ImGUI, no other third-party 
              dependencies are included. My goal is to build a C++ package like OpenMMLab (which is a Python package). Users can 
              call pre-defined components and quickly assemble a model for training. Moreover, I plan to build an interface that 
              users can build a model without writting a single line of code, like the Blueprint in Unreal Engine.
              <br>
              <br>
              I believe that buidling deep learning models will become more and more user friendly, and people with no coding 
              background should also be able to use it as a common tool, just like Unreal Engine opens a door to many game designers 
              who do not like coding.

              This project aims to build a neural network library and interface with C++, CUDA, and ImGUI, no other third-party 
              dependencies are included. My goal is to build a C++ package like OpenMMLab (which is a Python package). Users can 
              call pre-defined components and quickly assemble a model for training. Moreover, I plan to build an interface that 
              users can build a model without writting a single line of code, like the Blueprint in Unreal Engine.

              I believe that buidling deep learning models will become more and more user friendly, and people with no coding 
              background should also be able to use it as a common tool, just like Unreal Engine opens a door to many game designers 
              who do not like coding.
